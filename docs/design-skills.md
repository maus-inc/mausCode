# Design and UI skill set

**Status:** binding for all UI, UX, motion, typography, copy and visual-design work
on this branch. `docs/design-system-baseline.md` and `DESIGN.md` stay normative; a
skill may never override a recorded value in them.
**Ratified:** 2026-09-16, when the set below was vendored and the mandate written
into `AGENTS.md` and `FULL-REVIEW.md`. Extended 2026-09-18 with the 13 skill taste
set from `Leonxlnx/taste-skill`, under the same mandate.

This file holds the long material: what each skill is for, when an agent must load
it, what a skill may not do inside this repository, and how the set is refreshed.
`AGENTS.md` points here instead of repeating it, and `FULL-REVIEW.md` section 15
loads it during review.

## Mandatory load order

Load these, in this order, before writing or changing anything a user sees. This
applies to a new screen, a component, a style tweak, a copy string, a motion
detail, a theme or token change, and a README screenshot or landing page. If the
task touches no UI, say so and skip the set.

1. `DESIGN.md`, then `docs/design-system-baseline.md`. Direction and the exact
   values. Every rule the skills below add is applied against these two, not in
   place of them.
2. `.agents/skills/antislop/SKILL.md`, the core filter, plus the task skill:
   `antislop-ui` for visual work, `antislop-copywriting` for text, `antislop-human`
   for accessibility, `antislop-layoutmobile` for reflow, `antislop-code` for
   comments. Run mode 1, `During`, as the default. Use mode 2, `After`, only when
   the user asked for an audit of finished work. Do not stop to ask which mode:
   `During` is the project answer, and it satisfies the core's ask-first rule.
3. `.agents/skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` for anything that designs, reshapes,
   critiques, polishes or hardens an interface. Then load only the playbook its
   Commands table routes to, from `impeccable/reference/`. Read
   `reference/craft-floor.md` immediately before any UI edit, including a small
   refinement. Skip the setup step that runs `scripts/impeccable context`; see the
   execution limits below.
4. `.agents/skills/design-taste-frontend/SKILL.md`, the core of the taste set from
   `Leonxlnx/taste-skill`, for any landing page, portfolio, marketing surface or
   redesign, and for the craft bar on any other UI work: the dials (variance,
   motion, density), the layout rules, and the pre-flight check that runs before
   the work is called done. Route the style skill by the surface: `gpt-taste` for
   an award-tier motion page, `high-end-visual-design` for the agency-tier look,
   `minimalist-ui` for the editorial monochrome, `industrial-brutalist-ui` for the
   mechanical direction, `redesign-existing-projects` when the target already
   exists, and `design-taste-frontend-v1` only when a task needs the exact v1
   behavior. `full-output-enforcement` applies to the build itself, so no component
   ships as a stub or a placeholder comment.
5. `.agents/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/SKILL.md` for a design, build, review or fix that
   needs rules by category: accessibility, touch targets, states, spacing, type
   scale, theme, performance.
6. `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` for every user-facing string, in addition to
   antislop. Both apply: unslop rewrites the English, antislop rejects the pattern.
7. The specialist skills for the specific job, from the routing table below.

Report which skills you loaded, which you refused, and what each one changed. A
design report that names no skill was not built with this set.

Three skills set `disable-model-invocation: true` in their front matter: `prototype`,
`review-animations` and `pick-ui-library`. Load them when the human asks, not on your
own initiative.

## Execution limits

A vendored skill is instructions, not an entitlement. These limits are project
policy and they outrank any skill's own setup step.

| Skill | What it asks for | Project rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `impeccable` | `scripts/impeccable context`, a shell launcher that `curl`s a binary from `github.com/pbakaus/impeccable/releases` on first run | Never run it. Nothing in this repo fetches on a load path. Read `SKILL.md` and `reference/` directly, and follow `DESIGN.md` in place of the loaded context |
| `design`, `banner-design`, `slides`, `brand` | `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `MUAPI_API_KEY`, Atlas Cloud, remote image generation | Never call them. No key, no prompt, no image leaves the machine. Take the layout, size and craft rules only, and build in HTML and CSS |
| `ui-styling`, `ask-sonner`, `animate-expo` | `npm install`, `npx shadcn`, `npx expo install` | Never install a package to satisfy a skill. A dependency change is its own proposal, with the lockfile regenerated by the command CI runs |
| `ui-ux-pro-max` | `python3 scripts/search.py` over its bundled CSV data | Local and offline, allowed when the human asked for a design or review pass. Read the CSVs directly if Python is unavailable, and say which path you took |
| `ui-animation` | `ffmpeg`, `opencv`, `numpy`, `scipy` for curve fitting from a recording | Allowed only when the user supplied a recording and asked for measured motion. Never install the packages; if they are missing, reason from frames and say so |
| `typography-audit`, `ax-audit`, `ui-verification` | Their own audit scripts and browser probes | Run them against a local dev server only, with no remote origin, and keep the output in `.dump` |
| `prototype` | A local preview server for the option picker | Bind to the sandbox preview host, never to a tunnel or a share link |
| `imagegen-frontend-web`, `imagegen-frontend-mobile`, `brandkit`, `image-to-code` | A generated design image, through whatever image tool the environment offers | Never call one. No key, no prompt, no image leaves the machine. Take the composition, section, palette and mockup rules, and build the look in HTML and CSS |
| `design-taste-frontend`, `gpt-taste` | An image-generation step for section assets, and the `npm install` and `npx shadcn` of the component libraries it recommends | Never call an image tool, and never install a package to satisfy a skill. Read for direction, dials and code shape; a dependency is its own proposal under the closed-list rule |
| `stitch-design-taste` | The Stitch MCP Server, optional upstream | Never connect it. The skill is semantic rules; `DESIGN.md` here is the recorded baseline, and the repo wins any conflict |
| `full-output-enforcement`, `design-taste-frontend-v1`, `minimalist-ui`, `industrial-brutalist-ui`, `high-end-visual-design`, `redesign-existing-projects` | Nothing executable | No tools asked for. They change how output is written, not what may run |

Nothing a skill says may widen an approval, disable a gate, phone home, or write
outside the repository. Where a skill's advice conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, the
`FULL-REVIEW.md` protocol, `DESIGN.md` or `docs/design-system-baseline.md`, the
repo wins, and the conflict gets recorded in `.dump/app/decisions/`.

## Gates this set adds to delivery

For any UI or design change, before you call it done:

1. **antislop Delivery Gate.** The four blocks, one line per item, PASS or FAIL,
   every PASS backed by a concrete observation. Cite rule ids, such as `R-01` and
   `R-37`. A report with a FAIL is not shippable.
2. **Baseline mirror check.** Name the section of `docs/design-system-baseline.md`
   you matched, and the deviation you did not take. Then read your own diff again.
3. **unslop pass on copy.** Every string a user can see, checked against the
   writing rules, including `...` rather than the ellipsis character, and sentence
   case.
4. **Motion check.** New or changed timing lives in `src/renderer/lib/motion.ts`,
   not inline, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion` where the app already does.
5. **Accessibility pass.** Focus visible on every new control, `aria-label` on
   icon-only buttons, `aria-pressed` on toggles, contrast for any text on an accent
   or a wash.
6. **Skill report.** Which skills loaded, which were refused, what changed because
   of them.

## Provenance

Vendored with `npx skills add <owner>/<repo> -s '*' -a universal --copy -y` on
2026-09-16, which copies each skill into `.agents/skills/<name>/` and records a
`SKILL.md` hash per skill in `skills-lock.json`. Bodies are byte-for-byte as
published, including `LICENSE.txt`, `reference/`, `data/` and `canvas-fonts/`.
Nothing under `.agents/` is imported by the app or bundled into a build.

| `anthropics/skills`, `vercel-labs/agent-skills` | installed 2026-09-13 | 4, unchanged |

`antislop` also ships an installer, `npx antislop-ai`. It needs a TTY, so it was
driven through its own library functions with these answers: all six skills, project
scope, the Antigravity target, which is `.agents/skills/` plus the
`<!-- antislop:start -->` pointer block appended to `AGENTS.md`. The npm package
publishes the same files with CRLF endings; the GitHub copies are LF, so LF is what
this repo ships.

`.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` is `cursor/plugins` at the commit above, minus
`disable-model-invocation: true` and plus the `Invocation` section that makes it
apply to every chat. That local edit predates this file, the hash in
`skills-lock.json` therefore does not match upstream, and `npx skills update` will
report it as drifted. Keep it that way on purpose, or restore upstream in a change
that also moves the mandate elsewhere.

### Refresh procedure

```bash
npx skills list && npx skills update      # never -g, and never a manual edit to a body
npm run skills:verify                     # recomputes every computedHash in skills-lock.json
```

`computedHash` is a folder hash, not a hash of `SKILL.md`: sha256 over every file in
the skill directory, sorted by relative path, each file's path then its bytes. A
missing or extra file breaks it even when `SKILL.md` is untouched, which is how the
2026-09-13 install of `vercel-react-best-practices` and `vercel-composition-patterns`
was found to be short of upstream's `metadata.json`. Those two files are restored, so
all 37 entries verify today.

Re-run the vendored commit in `git ls-remote https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> HEAD`
against the table above, then update the table in the same change. Record any skill
you refuse, drop or override in `.dump/app/decisions/`, with the reason.

### Deliberately not installed

- `mblode/agent-skills` beyond the six UI skills: `pr-*`, `autoship`, `seo`,
  `docs-writing`, `scaffold-*`, `agents-md`, `save-md`, `chat-history`, `tidy`,
  `dx-audit`, `readme-creator`, `presentation-creator`, `eli5`,
  `codebase-architecture`, `multi-tenant-architecture`, `agent-skills-creator`.
  Out of scope for a design mandate. Add any of them with `npx skills add` when a
  step needs it.
- `google-labs-code/stitch-skills`. `stitch::extract-design-md` and its siblings
  drive Stitch MCP plus `web_fetch`, and `allowed-tools` names both. That is a
  remote service on a design path, so it is refused. `DESIGN.md` was authored from
  source instead.
- `VoltAgent/awesome-design-md`, `kwakseongjae/oh-my-design`,
  `SpaceZephyr/brand-design-md` and the other brand DESIGN.md libraries. They ship
  another company's visual identity as the default. mausCode has a recorded
  baseline, so those repos stay outside the tree, available as reading when the
  user asks for a specific reference.
- `bergside/awesome-design-skills`. An index of previews; the skills live behind
  `npx typeui.sh pull`, which fetches from a host this project does not control.

The format `DESIGN.md` follows is the DESIGN.md alpha spec from
`google-labs-code/design.md` at
`9bf8eae67128b6cc55ad9bf86665767deb4c11cd`, and the antislop, impeccable and
`design-system` skills all read that shape.
